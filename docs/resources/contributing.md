# Contributing

Simfinity.js is maintained by Simtlix and released under the Apache 2.0 License. Contributions to the library, examples, and documentation are welcome.

## Work on the library

Clone the repository and install the locked dependencies:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/simtlix/simfinity.js.git
cd simfinity.js
npm ci
```

Read `AGENTS.md` and the relevant files in `.cursor/rules/` before changing behavior. The project uses ES modules, Mongoose 8, GraphQL 16, and Vitest.

```sh
npm run lint
npm test
```

Add focused coverage for critical behavior and regressions. Keep the public documentation synchronized with API changes. A useful pull request explains the affected behavior, the change, and how it was validated.

## Improve the documentation

Use Node.js 22 or newer for the website tooling:

```sh
npm run docs:install
npm run docs:dev
```

Edit Markdown pages in `docs/guide`, `docs/reference`, or `docs/resources`. Add new pages to the sidebar in `docs/.vitepress/config.mts`. The site's dependencies are separate from the library's dependencies.

Before submitting:

```sh
npm run docs:build
npm run docs:preview
```

Check links, search, mobile navigation, code examples, and both color themes. The [website maintainer guide](https://github.com/simtlix/simfinity.js/blob/master/docs/.vitepress/README.md) covers the layout, assets, build configuration, and publication workflow.

## Report a problem

Open an [issue on GitHub](https://github.com/simtlix/simfinity.js/issues) with your package version, Node version, the relevant type definitions, the GraphQL operation, and the observed result. Include a minimal reproduction when possible. Remove credentials and private data from examples.
